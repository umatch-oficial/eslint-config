# @umatch/eslint-config

The eslint configuration used in Umatch's projects.

This is a very basic set of rules and plugins, intended to provide a minimum standard, but not too opinionated.

## Features
- Typescript ready (including absolute imports)
- Uses prettier
- Sorts imports
- Inserts blank lines before "const", "let" and "var" statements, unless the previous statement is also one of these
